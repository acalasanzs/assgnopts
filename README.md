# Assgnopts, the best input class

# Overview
The Assgnopts is a module to create inputs via dicts and arrays with several input check parameters


## Usage
First create an dictionary
```Python
dic = {
    0: ("Apples","kilos"),
    1: ("Oranges","units")
}
```
or use my built-in functions
```Python
dict = Ar2Dict(IterAr(2,"Object"),"units")
{
    0: ("Object 1","units"),
    1: ("Object 2","units")
}
```
    or
```Python
dict = Ar2Dict(["Apples","Oranges"],"units")
{
    0: ("Apples","units"),
    1: ("Oranges","units")
}
```
Then put it with all type of cutomizations and parameters:
```Python
MyObject = Assgn(Ar2Dict(IterAr(1,"Object"),"units"),conj="as",vals=range(1,10))
```
you can als print the object's values/inputs from the user:
```Python
MyObject.dispValues()
```

###  Getting it
